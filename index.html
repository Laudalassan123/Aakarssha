        <h2 class="question">There's a ton of things she don't know, And of course I'll take the blame. I'll try to make it obvious, But it seems my obvious will not be enough because she still seem to doubt And I know for a fact that I don't have her trust. I'm not good with words, I know how to spell them and what they mean, But I absolutely suck at using them to let my feelings be seen. I think the problem is that I like her very much, Even now, I can only hope my words get through, I really wish she'd understand although i m unknown to her. I'm utterly and irrevocably in love with her .when i saw her reply, it felt like fireworks are being set off in my belly, for the first time i experienced love at first sight , I'll keep loving her tomorrow, and the next day, and even next weak.
