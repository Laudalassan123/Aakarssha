        <h2 class="question">There's a ton of things you don't know, And of course I'll take the blame. I've tried to make it obvious, But it seems my obvious is not enough Because you still seem to doubt And I know for a fact that I don't have your trust. I'm not good with words,I know how to spell them and what they mean, But I absolutely suck at using them to let my feelings be seen. I think the problem is that I like you too much, Even now, I can only hope my words get through, I really wish you'd understand. I'm utterly and irrevocably in love with you .when i saw you text me, it felt like fireworks are being set off in my belly,but i didn't mean to fall for you. 
   I often do it when its someone like .-.-.-.-.-.-. 
            Do you like me?</h2>
